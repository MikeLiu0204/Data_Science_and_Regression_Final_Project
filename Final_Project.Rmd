## Abstract
This project examines state-level factors predicting whether Barack Obama or John McCain won in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Logistic regression models are used to analyze and compare predictors, identifying the most significant contributors to election outcomes.

## Introduction
The goal is to determine which state-level socioeconomic and political factors best predict election results using logistic regression. This analysis helps understand the relationships among predictors like income, education levels, and political leanings.

# Research Question


# Expected Findings
Note the target population.


# Methodology
The dataset of reference contains information from all 50 states and the District of Columbia for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
This analysis consists of 5 models, 4 of which investigates if Income (the Per capita income in the state as of 2007 (in dollars)), HS (percentage of adults with at least a high school education), BA (percentage of adults with at least a high school education), and Dem.Rep (the difference in the percentage democrat and the percentage of Republican), is associated with the odds that Obama (Democrat) wins state in 2008 (ObamaWin = 1), and 1 of which is an interaction model that investigates the joint effect of these 4 variables. 

# Dataset Information
data(Election08)
str(Election08)
summary(Election08)
The dataset includes 51 observations (50 states + DC) with variables related to income, education, and political alignment. The dependent variable is `ObamaWin`, a binary outcome (1 = Obama won, 0 = McCain won).

# Process
summary(Election08)

# Visualize relationships
ggplot(Election08, aes(x = Income, y = Dem.Rep, color = factor(ObamaWin))) +
  geom_point() + labs(color = "Obama Win")

# Check Conditions
The conditions for logistic regressions are linearity, randomness, and independence. 
Linearity: this means that there should exist a linear relationship between log(odds) and the predictor. 
The process of data collection is assumed to be random. Each observation is assumed to be independent. 

# Correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(Election08[, c("Income", "HS", "BA", "Dem.Rep")])
print(cor_matrix)

# Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
vif(lm(Dem.Rep ~ Income + HS + BA, data = Election08))

# Logistic regression for each predictor
models <- list(
  Income = glm(ObamaWin ~ Income, data = Election08, family = "binomial"),
  HS = glm(ObamaWin ~ HS, data = Election08, family = "binomial"),
  BA = glm(ObamaWin ~ BA, data = Election08, family = "binomial"),
  DemRep = glm(ObamaWin ~ Dem.Rep, data = Election08, family = "binomial")
)

# Summarize models
lapply(models, summary)

final_model <- glm(ObamaWin ~ Income + HS + BA + Dem.Rep, data = Election08, family = "binomial")
summary(final_model)

# Model Comparison
compare_metrics <- function(model, data, response) {
  # Predicted probabilities
  preds <- predict(model, type = "response")
  # Binary classification (threshold = 0.5)
  preds_class <- ifelse(preds > 0.5, 1, 0)
  
  # SSE: Sum of Squares for Error
  sse <- sum((data[[response]] - preds_class)^2)
  
  # SSM: Sum of Squares for Model
  mean_response <- mean(data[[response]])
  ssm <- sum((preds_class - mean_response)^2)
  
  # SSR: Total Sum of Squares
  ssr <- sum((data[[response]] - mean_response)^2)
  
  # R-squared
  r_squared <- 1 - (sse / ssr)
  
  # Adjusted R-squared
  n <- nrow(data)
  p <- length(coef(model)) - 1
  adj_r_squared <- 1 - ((1 - r_squared) * (n - 1) / (n - p - 1))
  
  list(SSE = sse, SSM = ssm, SSR = ssr, R_squared = r_squared, Adjusted_R_squared = adj_r_squared)
}

# Compute metrics for all models
model_metrics <- lapply(models, function(m) compare_metrics(m, Election08, "ObamaWin"))
model_metrics[["Final Model"]] <- compare_metrics(final_model, Election08, "ObamaWin")
